# Server-Side Application Documentation

This repository contains server-side application code that supports file upload, download, file listing, and authentication using both TCP and a custom Reliable UDP (RUDP) protocol.

## Overview

This Python script provides a server-side application that interacts with clients over both TCP and UDP protocols. It includes functionality for managing files (uploading, downloading, listing), user authentication, and error handling mechanisms to ensure reliability and data integrity.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Allows clients to upload files to the server.
- **File Download**: Supports clients in downloading files from the server.
- **File Listing**: Provides a list of files stored on the server.
- **User Authentication**: Validates client credentials (username and password).
- **Reliable UDP (RUDP)**: Implements a custom UDP-based protocol with ACKs and retransmissions for reliable data transfer.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for socket operations, authentication failures, and protocol mismatches.

## Setup

To set up and run the server-side application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher). Install the required Python libraries if necessary:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Server Settings**:
   - Open `server.py` and configure the `directory_name` where server files will be stored.
   - Set the `client_ip_address` to the IP address of the client.

4. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   The server will start and listen for incoming connections from clients.

## Usage

### Commands Supported

- **Upload**: Upload a file to the server.
- **Download**: Download a file from the server.
- **List**: Get a list of files stored on the server.
- **Close**: Close the connection with the client.

### Interacting with the Server

- **TCP Protocol**: Clients can connect using TCP for reliable communication.
- **RUDP Protocol**: Clients can choose RUDP for faster but less reliable communication.

### Example Workflow

1. Start the server and wait for client connections.
2. Connect a client using either TCP or RUDP.
3. Authenticate using valid credentials (username and password).
4. Execute commands (`upload`, `download`, `list`, `close`) to manage files or terminate the connection.
